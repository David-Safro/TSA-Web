      <p class = "about" id="space"> InterCon 2022 is a showcase of the culture that is the internet! The internet allows us to not only connect with one another over vast distances, but it allows us to showcase our creations to a much wider audience! With the internet, we are able to see another continent in near perfect detail. We can talk with other people we were never able to before. We learn about other cultures from their people and what they create. At the click of a few buttons, we can learn about the world and the ones who inhabit it. We become more educated on the lifestyles and cultures of those around us. </p>
